# Node TE

Seems the linear trend only persist when the network is activating at a slow pace, and only a small portion are included. For 100 nw linear trend is obvious. For 200 nw the fitting line is flatter. So on and so for. For 700 with multiple source/targets. It's hard to see the trend anymore. - Mainly because most of the junctions are included.
