Spectral radius of a network is the largest value of the adjacenct matrix. In our case will be the largest eigenvalue of the conductacne matrix.
$$
\alpha = max(eig(\vec{\textbf{G}}))
$$


==And in our network, the spectral radius seems like it's following the trend of collective conductance.==

Maybe one reason for the Mackey-Glass blowing up is spectral radius blowed up.
